A web-based application that allows practitioners to browse their patients and manage the generation of 3D models sourced from imaging studies like CT or MRI scans. The client-side application is accompanied by an API server that is responsible for communicating with the other components.

## Description

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11090412/62010806-49d5b180-b167-11e9-8be4-24958650d228.png" alt="screenshot" height="350" align="left" />

HoloRepositoryUI is intended to be the main interface for practitioners to browse their patients, preview imaging studies such as CT or MRI scans, and trigger the automatic generation of 3D models sourced from the scans in the HoloPipelines.

The UI primarily consists of a web-application running in the practitioner's browser. It is accompanied by an API server which communicates to the other systems: The hospital's FHIR server and PACS (respectively the stand-ins we deployed in Azure), the HoloPipelines and the HoloStorage Accessor. The back-end reads and maps data from FHIR.

If imaging studies for a patient exist, a preview of the scans will be shown. The underlying FHIR resource is ImagingStudy, which provides a wrapper around the actual DICOM data on the PACS. In the UI, each of these series provides the feature to start the automatic 3D model generation, and subsequently track its progress. After finishing, the HoloPipelines will automatically make the model available within HoloStorage.

In addition, existing 3D models (in binary glTF2 format) can be directly uploaded to the HoloStorage. To substitute the patient data contained in DICOM files, this workflow allows to add data manually and link the model to a FHIR Patient resource.

## Technologies

The client application is written in React 16.8, using TypeScript and built on top of `create-react-app`.

- Routing: [reach-router](https://github.com/reach/router)
- HTTP client: [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- Form validation: [formsy-react](https://github.com/formsy/formsy-react)
- Linting and formatting: [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) and [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- Styling: [office-ui-fabric-react](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react) and [ant-design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design)
- Testing: [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest), [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) and [axios-mock-adapter](https://github.com/ctimmerm/axios-mock-adapter)

The back-end is written in Node / Express 4.16 and TypeScript.

- HTTP client: [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- FHIR client and R4 type definitions: [fhir-kit-client](https://github.com/Vermonster/fhir-kit-client)
- Run-time type checkts: [io-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts) and [io-ts-promise](https://github.com/aeirola/io-ts-promise)
- Linting and formatting: [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) and [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- Testing: [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)

This app uses TypeScript to provide type safety, static analysis, code completion etc. To facilitate development and enhance confidence in the end-to-end system, both client and server are using the same type definitions.

## Architecture

The UI implements a traditional client-server architecture. The server is responsible for interacting with other systems (FHIR server, HoloPipelines, HoloStorage Accessor). It performs data validation and mapping, and sends the required data to the client.

The server's architecture follows common Express patterns: Every route has a dedicated router, controller and service. Furthermore, there is a client and a service module for each external system.

The client is a modular React application that is primarily split into the actual app (where users are after they authenticated) and a public area, that is accessible without login. The different routes correspond to different modules and submodules.

## Development

### Requirements

You need to have a recent version of `node` installed, for instance v12.6.0. `npm` (or `yarn`) can then be used to install all other dependencies.

### Getting started

#### Compile TypeScript

When you run the app for the first time (or after making changes to the type definitions), you have to compile TypeScript. Either run `tsc -b` manually or use the `npm` scripts provided in the sub-directory:

```shell
cd types
npm install
npm run build
```

Please refer to the `README` in the `/types` sub-directory for further instructions.

#### Install dependencies

This needs to be done in both the `client` and `server` sub-directories.

```shell
npm install
```

#### Run in development mode

```shell
# run server
cd server
npm run dev

# or run server in debug mode
cd server
npm run dev:debug

# run client
cd client
npm run start
```

### Local development

Once the API server is started locally, it will be available at [http://localhost:3001/api/v1](http://localhost:3001/api/v1). It can be tested, for instance using `curl`:

```shell
curl localhost:3001/api/v1/patients
```

If you run the React client at the same time, it will be using port `3000` and accessing the server at `3001`.

## Testing

Both client and server are tested using Jest.

```shell
# run client tests
cd client
npm run test

# run server tests
cd server
npm run test
```

Jest provides a couple of advanced features, for instance you can generate a coverage report with `npm run test -- --coverage` or run tests in an interactive loop via `npm run test -- --watch`.

## Build and deployment

### Local builds

To build the software locally, run

```shell
# compile and run server in production mode
cd server
npm run compile
npm start

# build client
cd client
npm run build
```

### Building and running the docker images

Note that the actual deployment leverages Docker. A `Dockerfile` is provided for both client and server and the typical development workflow uses Azure DevOps pipelines to build and release the app.

```shell
# client
docker build \
    --build-arg REACT_APP_BACKEND_HOST=http://localhost \
    --build-arg REACT_APP_BACKEND_PORT=3001 \
    --build-arg REACT_APP_BACKEND_TIMEOUT=15000 \
    --tag holorepository-ui-client \
    --file ./client/Dockerfile .
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name holorepository-ui-client holorepository-ui-client:latest

# server
docker build -t holorepository-ui-server -f ./server/Dockerfile .
docker run -d -p 3001:3001 --name holorepository-ui-server --env-file ./server/.env holorepository-ui-server:latest

# test connections
echo "Testing client" && curl http://localhost:3000/app/
echo "Testing server" && curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/patients
```

Note that the `Dockerfile`s are specified independently of the build context through the `-f` flag. This is necessary in order to copy `./types`, which would otherwise cause an error as it is outside the default build context. The build context therefore needs to be this parent directory.

## Integration

### Client-Server API specification

The internal API between the client and the server can be found in `server/src/routes.ts` and essentially consists of these routes:

-
- `/practitioners`
- `/patients`
- `/holograms`
- `/pipelines`
- `/imagingStudies`

### Other services

The server accesses the EHR FHIR server (respectively the stand-in we deployed on Azure) to read medical data concerned with patients, practitioners and imaging studies. To display information about and download/delete/upload holograms, it communicates with the HoloStorage Accessor API. Furthermore, to generate new holograms and enquire information about available pipelines, it communicates with the HoloPipelines through the respective API.
